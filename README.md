# Explanation of the Script
# 1.	Configuration:
api_key and api_secret: Your API credentials from the exchange.
symbol: The trading pair (e.g., BTC/USDT). timeframe: The timeframe for fetching OHLCV data (e.g., 1 minute).
short_window and long_window: The periods for the short and long moving averages.
# 2.	Initialize Exchange:
The script initializes the connection to the Binance exchange using the ccxt library with the provided API credentials.
# 3.	Fetch OHLCV Data:
The fetch_ohlcv function fetches Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) data for the specified trading pair and timeframe from the exchange.
# 4.	Calculate Moving Average:
The moving_average function calculates the moving average of the closing prices over the specified window period.
# 5.	Trading Strategy:
  The trading_strategy function implements a simple moving average crossover strategy. It calculates the short-term and long-term moving averages and generates buy/sell signals based on the crossover. If the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA, a buy signal (1) is generated.
If the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA, a sell signal (-1) is generated.
# 6.	Execute Trade:
The execute_trade function places market buy or sell orders based on the generated signals.
If a buy signal is detected, it uses all available USDT to buy BTC.
If a sell signal is detected, it sells all available BTC.
# 7.	Main Loop:
  The script runs an infinite loop where it fetches the latest OHLCV data, applies the trading strategy, and executes trades based on the generated signals.
  The script waits for 1 minute (time.sleep(60)) before fetching new data and repeating the process.
Note: This is a basic example and should not be used for live trading without thorough testing and improvements. Real trading bots need more robust error handling, risk management, and should be backtested on historical data.
